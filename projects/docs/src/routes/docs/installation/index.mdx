# Installation

1. Download installer

2. Run installer ([How to install on Mac](#how-to-install-on-mac))

3. Now you can run 
```bash
cominnek -v
```

## How to install on Mac

After mounting the installer maybe you would have some issues at the moment to run the installer on Mac since OS blocks the installer app. So you will need to run the `installer.sh` manually. 

### Install manually

1. Open the terminal.

2. Move into `Volumes` directory.

```bash
$ cd  /Volumes/cominnek-$version/
```

3. Run the bash installer
```bash
$ sudo bash installer.sh
```
