# Installation

1. Download installer

[![Macos](https://img.shields.io/badge/mac%20os-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Minnek-Digital-Studio/cominnek/releases/latest/download/cominnek-4.0.0.dmg) [![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white
)](https://github.com/Minnek-Digital-Studio/cominnek/releases/latest/download/cominnek-4.0.0.exe) [![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Minnek-Digital-Studio/cominnek/releases/latest/download/cominnek-4.0.0.deb)

2. Run installer ([See MAC Os steps](#how-to-install-on-mac))

3. Now you can run 
```bash
cominnek -v
```

## How to install on WSL

Next we will see how to install cominnek in WSL 2 and the necessary packages for authentication.

### Install Comminek

1. Open the terminal.
2. Download Package
```bash
wget https://github.com/Minnek-Digital-Studio/cominnek/releases/latest/download/cominnek-4.0.0.deb
```  
3. Install package cominnek.deb
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./cominnek-4.0.0.deb
```
4. Verify Installation
```bash
cominnek -v
```

### Install dependencies for auth.
If you have problem with xdg-open follow this steps

1. Install xdg-utils
```bash
sudo apt-get install xdg-utils
```
2. Add repository of wsl utils
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wslutilities/wslu
```
3. Update 
```bash
sudo apt update
```
4. Install wsl utils
```bash
sudo apt install wslu
```

## How to install on Mac

After mounting the installer maybe you would have some issues at the moment to run the installer on Mac since OS blocks the installer app. So you will need to run the `installer.sh` manually. 

### Install manually

1. Open the terminal.

2. Move into `Volumes` directory.
```bash
$ cd  /Volumes/cominnek-$version/
```

3. Run the bash installer
```bash
$ sudo bash installer.sh
```

*\* required*
## Branch
Create a new branch with the prefix `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/` or `release/` and the name of the branch will be the ticket number.

We are following a Git-Flow variant called [TAYO](https://mnk-docs.ngrok.io/guide/development/version-control/branch-management.html) by Minnek

```bash
cominnek branch feature "<Ticket>"
```
This the equivalent of: `git branch feature/{Ticket}`

| Command               | description                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------|
| `feature`       |  create a new feature branch from `develop` |
| `bugfix`        |  create a new bugfix branch from `develop` |
| `hotfix`        |  create a new hotfix branch from `master`|
| `release`       |  create a new release branch from `develop`|
| `support`       |  create a new support branch from `master`|
| `test`          |  create a new test branch from `develop`|
| `sync`          |  create a new sync branch from `develop`|

| Flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `<Ticket>`         |string*         |  ticket number |
| `-s --stash`       |boolean        | take the changes in the current branch and apply it to the new feature's branch          |

*\* required*

## Stash
Stash all the changes in the current branch and apply the changes to another branch.

```bash
cominnek stash "<Branch>"
```

| flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `<Branch>`         |string*         |  branch name |
## PR
Create a pull request as a draft directly to develop

```bash
cominnek pr
```
The flag `--ticket` is optional. If it's not provided this will take the ticket number from the current branch.

| flag               | type          | default | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------|
| `-t --ticket`      |string         | take by branch| name of the feature that's will be applied the change     |
| `-b --base`      |string         | `develop` |   base branch of the pull request.  |

In a case of a release branch, it will create a pull request to `master` and `develop`.

## Merge
Merge the current branch into the received one. This will help you save time when you are working on a feature branch and you want to merge, for example, the feature branch into the `test` branch.


```bash
cominnek merge "<branch>"
```


| flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `<branch>`      |string*         | name of the branch that's will be applied the changes       |

*\* required*

## Reset 
Reset the current branch to the selected commit. By default, it will reset to the last commit.

```bash
cominnek reset
```
This the equivalent of: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`

| flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `-c --commit`      |string         | commit hash       |
| `-y --confirm`     |boolean        | confirm the reset       |
| `   --hard`        |boolean        | Reset HEAD, index and working tree   |
| `   --soft`        |boolean        | Reset only HEAD      |
| `   --mixed`       |boolean        | Reset HEAD and index |
| `   --keep`        |boolean        | Reset HEAD, index and working tree      |
| `   --merge`       |boolean        | Reset HEAD, index and working tree      |
| `-n -number`       |number         | number of commits to reset       |

## Release (Experimental)

  ```
### PR

```

| Flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `-b --body`       |string*        | path to the template file |

*\* required*
#### Template file Example:
In some cases, you will want to set some dynamic values, for example, ticket number.

| Key                |    description     |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `${ticket}`        | Ticket number      |
| `${branch}`        | Head branch name   |


```markdown
# Example

- Ticket: ${ticket}
- Branch: ${branch}
```
## Auth

This command will help you to set the GitHub token.

```bash
cominnek auth -h
```

### Login

```bash
cominnek auth login
```

### Test
This command will help you to test the GitHub token.

```bash
cominnek auth test
```

### Logout

----
## Examples and more

You can add a body to commit using the `--message` flag twice.

```bash
cominnek push -m "Changes in home page" -f "home" -m "the title was aligned to right"
```
This is the same as
`git commit -m "fix(home):{Ticket} Changes in home page" -m "the title was aligned to right"`

*{Ticket} is the ticket number* See more information in the [Ticketing system](#ticketing-system)

---
To do a commit without a scope, use the flag and on windows, you should use it with a space. 

Mac Os and Linux:
```bash
cominnek push -m "theme setup" -b
```
Windows:

```powershell
cominnek push -m "theme setup" -b " "
```
the commit will be: `build: theme setup`

___ 
Move your changes to a new feature branch

```bash
cominnek feature "<Ticket>" -s
```

# Ticketing system
This takes the ticket number from the branch name. This is important to create the pull request with the correct ticket number.

Example: 

You are in the branch `feature/MJ-11` 

The ticker number will be `MJ-11`

If you execute the command:

```bash
cominnek push -m "Changes on homepage" -F "home"
``` 

the commit will be: `feat(home): MJ-11 Changes on the homepage`

### What about if I am not in a feature branch?
This going to let you know that you are not in a feature branch and you will accept the commit without a ticket number.

Example: You're in the branch `develop`

```bash
$ cominnek push -m "Changes in home page" -F "home"
  This is not a feature. Do you want to continue? (yes or no)
        Commit message: "feat(home): Changes in home page"
```
